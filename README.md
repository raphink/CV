# What is this

This is a repository that contains my up-to-date CV in LaTeX (`master` branch) and Web (`gh-pages` branch) versions.

## Live CV

You can find the live versions of the CV on http://raphink.info



# How to build

## Simple usage

To build all the versions (PDF and HTML), type `make`.


## PDF version

In order to build the PDF versions of this CV, you will need:

   * A LaTeX distribution (TeXLive 2012 recommended);
   * LuaTeX;
   * MinionPro, MyriadPro and Octicons fonts (you can find them under the fonts folder.  Just copy them to /usr/local/share/fonts).

To build the PDF CVs, type `make pdf`.


## HTML version

The HTML version of this CV is generated from the PDF version, using [pdf2htmlex](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX). Once you have `pdf2htmlex` in your `PATH`, type `make html` to build the files.


## Using octicons

In order to use the Octicons font, you will need to install this font. You can find it here: https://github.com/geniusgithub/github-android/raw/master/assets/octicons-regular-webfont.ttf

# About the `gh-pages` branch

This project has a `gh-pages` branch hosting the http://cv.raphink.info.

The `gh-pages` branch contains a simple static HTML page and the HTML CV files generated from `pdf2htmlex`.

The `index.html` page also allows to download the PDF CV files stored in the `master` branch.
