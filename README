What is this
------------

This is a repository that contains my up-to-date CV.

Building
--------

The CV is optimized to be built into a PDF using pdflatex.

In order to achieve this, you need:

   * A LaTeX distribution (TeXLive 2011 recommended);
   * LuaTeX;
   * MinionPro and MyriadPro fonts (you can find them with Acrobat Reader).

To build the PDF CVs, type `make`.
