I have been interested in Go ever since it came out publicly.

When I started using Consul and Docker/Rancher, I finally had the occasion to read code and start contributing in Go.

I strongly appreciated the thorough approach of this language, combining the speed and robustness of compiled and strongly typed languages with the agility of its structures and interfaces.

#### Projects

Among many contributions:

* [Bivac](https://github.com/camptocamp/bivac), a solution to automatically backup Docker containers
* [Upkick](https://github.com/camptocamp/upkick), a tool to provide unattended upgrades for Docker containers
* [Terraform Rancher Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-rancher), a [Terraform](https://terraform.io) provider to manage [Rancher](https://rancher.com) resources
* [Terraboard](https://github.com/camptocamp/terraboard), a web dashboard for [Terraform](https://terraform.io) states.
