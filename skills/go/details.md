I have been interested in Go ever since it came out publicly.

When I started using Consul and Docker/Rancher, I finally had the occasion to read code and start contributing in Go.

I strongly appreciated the thorough approach of this language, combining the speed and robustness of compiled and strongly typed languages with the agility of its structures and interfaces.
