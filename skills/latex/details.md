As most students, my first contact with LaTeX was in University.
However, it's when I started typesetting books that my interest for it really grew.

Since 2008, I have typeset several books in LaTeX for both paper and ePub publication, and have contributed packages to the community. After some time using standard LaTeX and then XeLaTeX, I settled with LuaLaTeX, and several of my packages make use of Lua.

Example work:

* [Packages on CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/author/pinson)
* [Books typeset in LaTeX](http://cc-translators.github.io)
* [1564 French Geneva Bible](https://github.com/raphink/geneve_1564)

I'm also been active in the [TeX StackExchange Community](https://tex.stackexchange.com/users/951/raphink) over the years.
