I have worked with Cert-Manager mainly in the context of
the [DevOps Stack project](https://devops-stack.io).

In order to integrate the Puppet CA into Kubernetes, I wrote a
[Cert-Manager Issuer for the Puppet CA](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppetca-issuer).
This led me to contribute an OpenSSL Extensions patch to Cert-Manager.
