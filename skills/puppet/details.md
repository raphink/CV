I heard about Puppet early on. At the time, I was using Cfengine 2 to manage our servers, and Puppet seemed very promising, as it solved many of the downfalls I had experienced with Cfengine (no templating, confusing semi-declarative language, etc.). I started using it for personal needs (as my employer refused to migrate at the time), and later joined one of the earliest companies to have adopted Puppet for its infrastructure: Camptocamp.

Over the years, I developed an expertise for this tool, becoming a Puppet trainer (teaching both Puppet Labs' official curriculum and my own courses), a Puppet contributor, and the author of many modules.
