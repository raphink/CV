#### Lenses

When the [Augeas](http://augeas.net) project was first presented to me in 2007, I was very enthusiastic and started contributing new lenses very early. I quickly became the main contributor of Augeas [lenses](https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/tree/master/lenses).

#### API contributions

Later on, I contributed C code for the API, and contributed to bindings code for [Python](https://github.com/hercules-team/python-augeas), [Ruby](https://github.com/hercules-team/ruby-augeas) and [Perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-Augeas/).

#### Augeasproviders

I joined [Dominic Cleal](https://github.com/domcleal) when he started the [Augeasproviders project](http://augeasproviders.com) and am now the main developer.


#### Other Augeas-based projects

* [Config::Augeas::Validator](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-Augeas-Validator/) is a Perl module to validate configuration against Augeas lenses.

* [Reprepro::Uploaders](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Reprepro-Uploaders/) is a Perl module to compute [reprepro](https://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org) permissions. It uses Augeas to parse reprepro permissions files.
* [Puppetfile-updater](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppetfile-updater) is a Ruby gem to manage [Puppetfiles](https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/blob/master/doc/puppetfile.mkd). It uses Augeas to parse and modify the Puppetfile.


#### Talks and trainings

I have talked about Augeas [at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0MJaIv4bgk) [various](http://raphink.github.io/augeas-talks) [conferences](https://archive.fosdem.org/2009/schedule/speakers/raphael%2Bpinson.html) and have written and taught a [one-day course](http://www.camptocamp.com/en/formation/augeas-training-fundamentals/) on using Augeas.
