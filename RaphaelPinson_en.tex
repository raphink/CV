          {Cloud Native Tech Evangelist}
          {\href{http://www.camptocamp.com}{Camptocamp}}
          {Chambéry then Lausanne}
          {}
          {
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Puppet \& Cloud}\newline
      When I joined Camptocamp, the instructure team's activity focused on
      managing 500+ servers on behalf of clients, using mainly \textbf{Puppet}, \textbf{OpenVZ}, and \textbf{Amazon Web Services}.
    \item \emph{Partnerships \& Training}\newline
      In order to leverage our team's renowned expertise in Puppet,
      I set up a \textbf{strategic partnership} with Puppet Labs and started teaching the official
      Puppet curriculum. This required me to be certified by both the \textbf{Puppet Professional} and \textbf{Puppet Developer} certifications.
      I also wrote our own curriculum based on \textbf{Foreman} for clients using Open Source Puppet, 
      as well as an \textbf{Augeas} curriculum.\newline
      Since then, I have been a \textbf{trainer} to many engineers at major banks, universities (EPFL, Unibe), research facilities (CERN, CNRS), and many more.
    \item \emph{Open Source Work}\newline
      As our team managed tens of public open-sourced Puppet modules, I strived to improve quality
      by implementing \textbf{unit and acceptance tests}, publishing on the Puppet forge, and getting approvals by Puppet Labs as standard implementations. I also managed the \textbf{Augeasproviders} project and maintained the Puppet modules associated with it.
      My Puppet expertise led to many \textbf{consulting} missions, ranging from architecture to migration,
      as well as specific \textbf{Ruby} development, and earned me a recognition as \textbf{Puppet Champion of the year 2020}, with a title of \textbf{Extraordinary Puppeteer}.
    \item \emph{Terraform}\newline
      With our use of public clouds broadening, we switched our provisioning from \textbf{Cloud Formation} to \textbf{Terraform} and contributed multiple providers and modules to the community.
      I authored \textbf{Terraboard}, a UI to visualize Terraform states, written in \textbf{Go} and \textbf{AngularJS}.
    \item \emph{Containers \& Orchestration}\newline
      Around 2014, we moved our Puppet acceptance tests from \textbf{Vagrant} to \textbf{Docker}.
      We realized Docker's potential, and moved our Puppet stack on top of it.
      Starting with \textbf{Docker-Compose}, we switched to \textbf{Rancher} in 2015 to scale the infrastructure horizontally, and became \textbf{Rancher Partner}.
      We wrote containers tools such as \textbf{Bivac}, to automate volumes backup.
      I migrated the Puppet stack to \textbf{OpenShift} around 2018. \newline
      \textbf{Kubernetes} expertise is now our main activity. I have co-authored and taught a 5-day curriculum covering Docker and Kubernetes.
      In the meanwhile, I have contributed to getting Camptocamp set up as one of the first \textbf{Kubernetes Certified Service Provider} (KCSP) in Switzerland and the first \textbf{Kubernetes Training Partner} (KTP) in Europe.\newline
      I completed the \textbf{OpenShift Administration}, \textbf{CKAD}, \textbf{CKA}, and \textbf{CKS} certification programs.\newline
      In the last year, I have co-authored the \textbf{DevOps Stack}, a solution integrating \textbf{Terraform}, \textbf{ArgoCD}, \textbf{OIDC},
      \textbf{Træfik}, \textbf{Cert-Manager}, \textbf{Prometheus}, \textbf{Grafana} and more into a framework to easily provision Kubernetes clusters in a \textbf{GitOps} fashion
      —using \textbf{GitLab} or \textbf{GitHub Actions} pipelines—
      on \textbf{Amazon EKS}, \textbf{Azure AKS}, \textbf{Exoscale SKS}, \textbf{Deutsche Telekom CCE}, \textbf{Rancher K3S}, \textbf{Kind}, and more.
    \item \emph{Sales \& Marketing}\newline
      As an expert, I have often
      supported our \textbf{sales force} and contributed to multiple \textbf{tenders}.
      My attachment to Camptocamp's image and values has also encouraged me to improve \textbf{marketing} (through market studies, newsletters, blog posts, videos, white papers, designing illustrations, totems \& goodies).
      I have represented Camptocamp at many \textbf{conferences and meetups} (both physical and online) on various subjects (Puppet and its ecosystem, Cloud, DevOps, etc.).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Cfengine}\newline
    I was originally hired to migrate about 3000 machines from \textbf{Cfengine} 1 to Cfengine 2.
    This was an opportunity for me to learn about \textbf{Configuration Management} principles and to discover \textbf{Puppet} and \textbf{Augeas} along the way.
  \item \emph{Package build farm \& repository}\newline
    Migration to Cfengine 2 was an opportunity to standardize software packages used.
    I set up a new automated Debian package repository using \textbf{reprepro}
    and a \textbf{Debian buildd} farm to compile the packages for multiple distributions and architectures. Both i386 and amd64 builders ran on a single machine, using \textbf{LXC} containers as light virtualization to isolate contexts.\newline
    I encouraged developers to package their applications and helped them set up \textbf{CI/CD} pipelines using \textbf{Hudson} (now \textbf{Jenkins}) to automatically release their packages to the repository, using \textbf{GnuPG} keys as the authentication layer.\newline
    In order to encourage good practices, I taught multiple sessions of a \textbf{Debian packaging curriculum} to several internal teams.
  \item \emph{Gforge}\newline
    I administered a Gforge platform for hundreds of developers.
    As part of this task, I set up a replicated fallback server and wrote a CVS replication software using \textbf{Perl}, \textbf{PostgreSQL}, and \textbf{inotify}.
  \item \emph{Policy Conformity}\newline
    In order to improve \textbf{conformity} to standards as we adopted \textbf{ITIL} processes,
    I designed \textbf{Treetester}, a Perl software working as a sieve of tests to identify priority
    actions to take on machines and platforms and report to platform administrators in a Web UI.
